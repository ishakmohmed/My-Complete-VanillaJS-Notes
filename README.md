# My-Complete-VanillaJS-Notes
Contains all the codes that I've written when I first learned JavaScript from Mosh Hamedani on YouTube.

## Disclaimer:
This is my notes and it's an entire mess, because I tend to write a lot of comments in the code. Also, the files are a total mess because I didn't know proper file structuring when I first learned JavaScript. Anyway, this repo is sort of a playground repo/notes that I refer to occasionally.
